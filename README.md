# Physics Playground 🎮⚡

A Flutter project that demonstrates a **drag & drop mini physics simulation** using  
`Draggable` and `DragTarget` widgets.  
Users can drag colored balls into matching colored containers with fun visual feedback.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Colored Balls**: At least 3 draggable balls (Red, Green, Blue).  
- 📦 **Matching Containers**: Each ball has a matching target container.  
- 🖌 **Visual Feedback**:  
  - Targets highlight with their border color when hovered.  
  - Arrow ↓ icon appears only when a ball is above a target.  
  - Target becomes solid when correctly matched.  
- ✅ **Success State**:  
  - Shows ✔ check when correct match is made.  
- ❌ **Incorrect Drop Handling** *(optional)*:  
  - Can show a cross ✖ when a ball is dropped in the wrong container.
